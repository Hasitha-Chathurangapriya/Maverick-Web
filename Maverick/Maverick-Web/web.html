                                Advanced robotics is a field of robotics that focuses on the development of more
                                intelligent, capable, and adaptable robots. Advanced robots use a variety of
                                technologies to perceive their surroundings, make decisions, and perform tasks
                                autonomously. Advanced robots have the potential to revolutionize many industries and
                                applications.

                                and do not produce greenhouse gases. Renewable energy is becoming increasingly important
                                as we seek to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and combat climate change.
